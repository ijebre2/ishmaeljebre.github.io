										<h2><a href="https://github.com/ijebre2/instantons-and-its-applications-undergraduate-final-year-project-">Final Year Undergraduate Thesis Project- Instantons and Its Applications</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ijebre2/instantons-and-its-applications-undergraduate-final-year-project-" class="image fit"><img src="images/undergraduate thesis logo.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										My undergraduate thesis, "Instantons and Its Applications," conducted at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, delved into the fascinating world of instantons‚Äîpseudo-particles and solutions to non-linear wave equations in theoretical and mathematical physics. Under the supervision of Dr. Ishmael Takyi, this research aimed to explore the interactions of instantons and anti-instantons, specifically utilizing the œï4 model.	
									<ul>
										<b>Key Components</b>
										<li><p>The methodology involved a rigorous derivation of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories, including the application of Noether's theorem to understand conservation laws. A core component of the study was the derivation of instanton and anti-instanton solutions, along with their energy densities, from the œï4 theory.</p></li>
										<li><p>Through graphical analysis and illustrative examples using MATLAB application, the thesis demonstrated key findings regarding the dynamic behavior of these pseudo-particles. It was observed that at initial stages, instantons and anti-instantons tend to move apart, resulting in energy loss. Conversely, at later times, they exhibit a tendency to approach each other, leading to a regain of energy upon collision. Furthermore, the research highlighted that an increase in velocity correlates with a wider separation distance between instantons and anti-instantons.</p></li>
										<li><p>his project significantly enhanced my understanding of advanced mathematical physics, non-linear dynamics, and the application of theoretical concepts to model complex physical phenomena, reinforcing my analytical and problem-solving skills. </p></li>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/ijebre2">Mathematical Modeling for Food Security in Ghana</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am deeply interested in addressing the critical issue of food security in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa. My future work will leverage mathematics, statistics, and data science to develop predictive models and data-driven strategies that support agricultural policy, food supply chains, and sustainable development.</p>
									<ul><b>Project Objectives:</b>
										<li><p>Agricultural Yield Prediction: Use statistical regression models, satellite data, and climate variables (rainfall, temperature, soil moisture) to predict crop productivity at regional and national scales.</p>  </li>

										<li> <p>Optimization of Resource Allocation: Apply operations research and linear programming to optimize the distribution of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, water) across regions with limited access and variable need.</p></li> 

										<li> <p>Risk Assessment & Food Availability Modeling: Develop stochastic models to assess risks of crop failure, food shortages, and price volatility due to factors like climate change, market disruptions, or pest outbreaks.</p></li>
									<p>This project aligns with national priorities around food self-sufficiency, resilience, and equitable access. By integrating mathematical modeling with real-world agricultural data, I aim to support stakeholders‚Äîfrom farmers to policymakers‚Äîin making informed, data-backed decisions to enhance food security in Ghana.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/ijebre2">Applying Mathematics & Data Science in Public Health</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p><ul>As I continue my journey in Data Science and Applied Mathematics, I am particularly passionate about contributing to the field of Public Health, with a focus on Epidemiology. My future projects will explore the intersection of mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and real-world health challenges in Africa and beyond.
										<li>Epidemiological Modeling: Designing and analyzing compartmental models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) to simulate the spread of infectious diseases and evaluate intervention strategies.</li>
										<li>Predictive Analytics for Disease Outbreaks: Using machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to predict disease trends, identify hotspots, and optimize resource allocation.</li>
										<li>Health Data Visualization & Interpretation: Creating dashboards and visual tools for public health agencies to monitor health indicators, vaccine coverage, and epidemiological trends.</li>
										<li>Mathematics of Vaccination & Herd Immunity: Investigating thresholds for herd immunity and the role of stochastic processes in vaccine uptake and epidemic thresholds.</li>
										These projects aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice‚Äîusing quantitative insights to guide policy, support healthcare systems, and improve health outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings.</ul> </p>
